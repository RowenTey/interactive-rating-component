# 💯 Interactive Rating Component

This is a solution to the [Interactive rating component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI).

## ❓ The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

2. DOM Manipulation (Read JS Documentation!)
3. HTML Dataset (Read HTML Documentation!)
